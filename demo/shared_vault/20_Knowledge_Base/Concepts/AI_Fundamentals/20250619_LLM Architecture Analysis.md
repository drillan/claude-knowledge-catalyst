# LLM Architecture Analysis

## Current Trends in 2024

### Mixture of Experts (MoE)
- Sparse activation patterns improve efficiency
- Conditional computation based on input type
- Reduced inference costs for large models

### Context Length Extensions
- Techniques like RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding)
- Memory-efficient attention mechanisms
- Long-context applications (100K+ tokens)

### Multi-modal Integration
- Vision-language models (GPT-4V, Claude-3)
- Audio processing capabilities
- Unified embedding spaces
